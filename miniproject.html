    <h1>About Cupcake</h1>
    <p>
        A cupcake is a small cake designed to serve one person, which may be baked in a 
        small thin paper or aluminum cup. As with larger cakes, frosting and other cake 
        decorations such as fruit and candy may be applied.

    <h2>Recipe</h2>
    <p>
      A standard cupcake uses the same basic ingredients as standard-sized cakes: butter, 
sugar, eggs, and flour. Nearly any recipe that is suitable for a layer cake can be used to 
bake cupcakes. The cake batter used for cupcakes may be flavored or have other 
ingredients stirred in, such as raisins, berries, nuts, or chocolate chips.

    <h2>Cupcake kits</h2>
    <p>
      Typically kits include appropriately decorated cupcake cases and cupcake 
toppers but some kits are available which also include the ingredients needed for baking. 
Cupcake kits were introduced in 2008 or 2009 and continue to be popular items in 
kitchenware stores.
